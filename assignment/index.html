    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <!-- Create an unordered list with any questions you have -->
    <ul>
      <li>Why is a called function inside a console.log listed as undefined in the console when the function has already been executed? ie: console.log('Removing all items in basket', empty()); // returns Removing all items in basket undefined</li>
      <li>Am I able to redeclare a function after the first time? For stretch goals I got an error when I tried to reassign the value of function addItem, so I instead just changed the original function to reflect the stretch goals. Can I change addItem later in the code though?</li>
    </ul>
